# Get Lamp - Applesoft BASIC

Here you can find two implementations of the Get Lamp in Applesoft BASIC:
1. getlamp.bas - pure text implementation.
2. getlamp-graphics.bas - implementation with text + graphics.

## Importing the source code into a usable .DSK image

1. Create a new DSK image using AppleCommander.
2. Open the image using CiderPress and use the menu option Actions -> Import BAS from text.
