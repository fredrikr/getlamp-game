# Get Lamp Inform 7 Notes

See - https://github.com/taciano-perez/getlamp-game

This project from Taciano Perez was very similar to my own first text adventure game (on a ZX Spectrum). For fun I thought I'd have a go at recreating it in Inform 7 - probably the most advanced interactive fiction language.

Changes -

* Added 'light' as a synonym of 'switch on' - as Inform already has a light switch mechanism.
* Changed Dark Room to Waiting Room - If you have the lit lamp it isn't dark.
* Didn't bother with a new (dark) description of Dark Room - Inform already has a default one. The same goes for several other default messages.
* Changed the Locked Door to Black Door - As it isn't always locked. Although condition room descriptions are possible, but weren't in the original.
* Note: The World Outside room isn't really needed, except for testing purposes.

If it is of interest I could add other versions.
